    "## 1101. The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends\n",
    "\n",
    "There are n people in a social group labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array logs where logs[i] = [timestampi, xi, yi] indicates that xi and yi will be friends at the time timestampi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friendship is symmetric. That means if a is friends with b, then b is friends with a. Also, person a is acquainted with a person b if a is friends with b, or a is a friend of someone acquainted with b.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. If there is no such earliest time, return -1.\n",

    "Explanation:   \n",
    "The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101 and after 0 and 1 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].  \n",
